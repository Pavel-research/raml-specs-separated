# Metamodel

This documents describe the terms which we use to build RAML dialects. The one way to build RAML dialect is to define and specify set of `Fragments`(Classes/Types/Shapes) which compose the language. 

Each `Fragment` has a set of the `properties` which are allowed to be met in its definition. Some of this properties may be required or pattern properties.
