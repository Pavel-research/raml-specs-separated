# RAML Specifications Separated

This repository contains an attempt to extract few parts of RAML specifications in separate mini specifications and to make them available as a building blocks for usage in describing new RAML dialects. 

Concepts:

* [Includes](includes.md) - describe mechanism which may be used to bring structural includes into the language
* [Libraries](libraries.md) - describes an abstract library fragment which may be used to bring library support into your dialect of RAML
* [Overlays&Extensions](overlays.md) - describes extensions mechanism and additional semantic validation which is associated with abstract `Overlay` and `Extension` fragments.
* [Data Types](types.md) - describes RAML type system, Type Declaration fragments.
* [Annotations](annotations.md) - describes annotations and annotations types properties.

Mental Framework:
* [Metamodel](metamodel.md) - short description of mental framework which may be used to describe RAML dialect.

Examples:
 * [Vehicles](example.md) - example of the specifications language
